# Welcome to the blog!

My name is Marcos Rivera-Almazo. I have a MSc in Chemistry (on Computational Chemistry, or Comp. Chem.) and I'm currenty 
doing a PhD also in Chemistry, also in Comp.Chem, also at UAM-Iztapalapa (Mexico). 

Here I will record some of the discoveries that eventualy will arise from doing a PhD in Comp. Chem..

My current main project consists in elaborating a library for the resolution of bielectronic integrals (both Coulomb and
Exchange ones) for periodic systems, using a basis set of Gaussian Type Orbitals (GTOs). For the computation
we are trying to implement heterogeneous computing practices, so we may be able to run on CPUs, GPUs or a mix of both.

Hope you enjoy the content I will upload! :)
